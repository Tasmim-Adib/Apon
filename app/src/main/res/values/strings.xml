    <string name="about"> <b>Apon</b> is a non-profit blood donation platform lead by <b>Health Data Research Organization.</b>
        Primarily Apon is dedicated to <b> Thalassemia</b> patients.As we know, Thalassemia patients need 1-2 bags of blood every month.
        It is challenging to manage this amount of blood of their own. However,
        if we work together, it will be easier for them. That is why Apon comes in.</string>

    <string name="secondAbout">Previously, we managed donors by calling them on demand.
        It is not only for Thalassemia patients but also for all critical patients.
        However, why is Apon dedicated to Thalassemia now? There are many blood donation organizations
        out there that contribute a lot. In a critical moment, they managed blood for patients selflessly.
        That is why Apon is dedicated to thalassemia patients in Bangladesh.

        However, <b>Bangladesh Thalassemia Foundation </b>
        has a registration porta to manage donors.
        We are trying to build an Android App for helping thalassemia patients.
        By using this app, they can manage donors location-wise easily. Besides, they can find donors using Hospital
        name. We have also made a link with the most reputed blood donation organization <b>Badhan, Sandhani, Red Crescent Society
         and Medicine Club</b> . People can find donor through this organizations.
